## Inspiration
At my time while volunteering at a hospital, I observed that often there would be EMS bringing in patients without being able to check if the hospital actually had rooms and beds available in the Emergency Room. There were doctors and nurses running from patient to patient, getting information from each person and trying to decide who to see first all the while as EMS brought in more patients. It was chaos and I thought that there had to be something to change this problem and help both the staff and patients get the efficiency and care that they deserve.

## What it does
This application is meant to be used on a tablet or something similar by EMTs in ambulances. This application takes out the guesswork and luck of finding an open bed in a hospital and optimizes routing, keeping in mind the sensitivity of time and the PT's vitals. Additionally, this application allows for the flow of information directly from the ambulance to a waiting doctor in an "open-bed" hospital, which allows the patient to receive care faster and without the hassle of extended paperwork.

## How we built it
We used the Python Flask framework to build this application. We also utilized the ArcGIS API to make the mapping and destination routing possible. There is a certain amount of machine learning implemented as well, with the use of Custom Vision from Microsoft as a means of helping EMTs sign in to the system at the beginning of their shift.

## Challenges we ran into
We had to learn how to use ArcGSI. It was also Shrabonti's first hackathon and first real coding heavy project. It was a challenging, yet rewarding time having to adapt to the new types of challenges for her.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we have a functional prototype of the initial vision of the application. All of the components we wanted to implement are here in some fashion.

## What we learned
We learned the importance of time management and working under pressure. It was also interesting learning about how ArcGSI functioned and its uses in this field.

## What's next for Evia
We want to show off this idea to people and see what they think. Everyone's feedback would mean a lot!
