Esri ArcGIS API
inventory

project idea:
  EMS have a detachable tablet which can signal hospitals in nearby
proximities (Esri ArcGIS API) about open beds and also notify them about the
conditions and vitals of the patient and also inform the hospital if they are
low on inventory/supplies.


**
the eight-minute target became the rigid ultimate standard of EMS operations.
In extreme cases, ambulance services have been penalized for not meeting the
standard of eight minutes. Ambulances move 20 mph.

**
EMRs staff rural ambulance stations, community volunteer ambulance services,
fire departments, police departments, industrial ambulances or mobile treatment
centers.
